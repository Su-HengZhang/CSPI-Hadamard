# Matlab source code for numerical simulation of CSPI

## Main functions

1. `PatternImage` simulate the structured illumination light field
                  produced by the Hadamard basis pattern
                  (pattern image by 4f system)

2. `CSPI` simulate the complex-amplitude single-pixel imaging
          using coherent structured illumination

## Called functions

1. `pad2center` pad around matrix with 0

2. `pad2centerx2` pad around matrix with 0 to 2x

3. `system4filter` frequency domain filtering with 4f system

    * `lpfilter` computes frequency domain lowpass filters

        * `dftuv` computes meshgrid frequency matrices

## Data

* `usaf1k` the sampling matrix (1000*1000) of the USAF-1951 resolution
           test chart (partial) with 1 Âµm sampling interval
